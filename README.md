# SimpleDB
SimpleDB is a multi-user transactional database server developed by Edward Sciore from Boston College. It serves as an educational tool for students to learn and implement the internals of a database system. 

As part of the course [CS3223](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tankl/cs3223/project.html) from NUS, we implemented several essential components related to **query processing**. Examples include `Hash Index`, different `Join` and `aggregates` operators.

We also developed basic tests to prevent regression errors and verify the correctness of our implementation.
